### Suggesting Enhancements

 Please include as much detail as possible including the steps that you imagine you would take if the feature you're requesting existed, and the rational and reasoning of why this feature would be a good idea for a co-simulation framework.

 A pull request including a bug fix or feature will always be welcome.

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to UNITS? You can start by looking for [`help wanted`]

### Submitting a pull request
Typically you would want to submit a pull request against the develop branch.  That branch gets merged into master periodically but the develop branch is the active development branch where all the code is tested and merged before making a release.  There is a [Pull request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) that will guide you through the needed information.  The pull requests are run through several automated checks in Travis and AppVeyor and for the most part must pass these tests before merging.  The Codacy check is evaluated but not required as the checks are sometimes a bit aggressive.

## Styleguides
Code formatting is controlled via clang-format
