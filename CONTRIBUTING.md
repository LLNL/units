### Submitting a pull request

Typically you would want to submit a pull request against the master branch. The pull requests are run through several automated checks in Travis and CircleCI and for the most part must pass these tests before merging. The goal is 100% coverage so if a new feature is added, then it should have tests to cover the new code. The Codacy check is evaluated but not required as the checks are sometimes a bit aggressive.

## Styleguides

Code formatting is controlled via clang-format
