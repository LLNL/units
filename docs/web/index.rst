Units on the Web
==================

You can try out the string conversions through the units 
`Webserver <../_static/convert.html>`_

This page allows you to enter a measurement string and a unit string for conversion.

The measurement string can be of any form with a number and units 

-   `10 m` 
-   `hundred pounds` 
-   `45.673 GB` 
-   `dozen feet`

the unit string should be some unit that is convertible from the measurement units: 

-   `inches`
-   `troy oz`
-   `kiB`
-   `british fathoms`

The conversion also supports mathematical operations  see :ref:`Units From Strings` for additional details on string conversions
