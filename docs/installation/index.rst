Installation and Linking
----------------------------

The units library supports a header only mode and a compiled mode.  One of the strengths of the library is the string processing which is only available in the compiled mode.  Other additions from the compiled mode are the root operations on units and measurements.    The header only mode includes the unit and measurement classes conversions between them and the definition library.
