==================
Defined Units
==================

The units library comes with two sets of units predefined.  They are all located in `src/units/unit_definitions.hpp <https://github.com/LLNL/units/blob/master/units/unit_definitions.hpp>`_.
The definitions come in two flavors a precise_unit and a regular unit.  All the precise units are defined in the namespace `units::precise`

All the units are defined as a constexpr values.  The choice of which units to define is somewhat arbitrary and guided by the authors experience and the origins of the library in power systems and electrical engineering in the US.
Units that the author has actually encountered in work or life are included and in cases where there might be conflicts depending on the location preference was given to the US customary definition, though international systems take priority.

Listing of Units
--------------------

The most common units are defined in the namespace `units::precise` and others are defined in subnamespaces.

Base Units
================
Most base units have two definitions that are equivalent

- meter, m
- kilogram, kg
- second, s
- Ampere, A
- Kelvin, K
- mol
- candela, cd

Specialized units
==================
Some specialized units are defined for use in conversion applications or for making handling string conversions a little easier

- defunit - special unit that signifies conversion to any other units is possible
- invalid - special unit that conversion has failed
- error - an error unit

Numerical Units
===================
Sometimes it is useful to have pure numerical units, often for multiplication with other units such as `hundred*kg` or something like that which becomes a single unit with 100 kg.

Units in the `units` namespace
-------------------------------------
Regular units are defined in the `units` namespace.  The general rule is that any units with a definition directly in `units::precise` has an analog `nonprecise` unit in the `units` namespace.
One addition is that any unit defined in `precise::electrical` also is defined in `units` this has to do with the origins of the library in power systems.
